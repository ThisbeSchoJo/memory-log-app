# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Memory Log App
## Description
The Memory Log App is a web application designed to capture and share special memories with loved ones. Users can log memories, each associated with a unique color generated by AI based on the mood of the memory. This app allows users to document shared experiences, and each entry includes a color and potential music association (via Spotify API integration).

The project is built with React, React Router, and json-server to simulate a backend for storing memories. It aims to provide a space for reflection, allowing users to relive meaningful moments together.

## Features
Memory Logging: Users can log memories with an AI-generated color based on the mood of the entry.
Color-coded Memories: Memories are associated with a unique color generated automatically from the entry text.
Memory List: View a list of logged memories with colors that represent their moods.
Simple Navigation: Navigate through various pages (Memory Log, About, etc.) with React Router.
Music Association (Future Feature): Integration with Spotify to associate music with memories (planned for future versions).
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: json-server (RESTful API)
Styling: CSS (or styled-components)
Routing: React Router
AI Integration: OpenAI for color generation based on mood from memory text
Music Integration: Spotify API (future enhancement)
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/ThisbeSchoJo/memory-log-app.git

2. Navigate to the Project Folder
Go into the project directory:
cd memory-log-app

3. Install Dependencies
Install the project dependencies:
npm install

4. Set Up json-server
In a separate terminal window, navigate to your project folder and run json-server:
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
This will simulate a backend for your app and store the memories in db.json.

5. Start the React App
In your main terminal window, start the React app:
npm start
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to start using the app!
